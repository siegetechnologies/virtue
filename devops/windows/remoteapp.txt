Create directory with 1 workspace, let the workspace user be called user1
Create a domain joined windows instance in the same VPC, this will be your
virtue instance (VI)

Login to VI using Domain admin password (the one you used when you created the
directory service)
Open Control Panel -> User Accounts -> Give others access to this computer
Enter user1 for User Name, and the Directory common name in domain (in our case, SIEGE)
Click Next
Select the "other" radio button and open the dropdown to select "Remote Desktop Users"
Click Next
Verify the Domain user matches the workspace user and click "Finish"

Verify this step by opening a remote desktop session from the Workspace to the 
VI using the workspace user's credentials. You should see the whole desktop.
Save the configuration to a .rdp file somewhere, you will use this later

If the following link is broken, here is a rundown of the steps
Assume we want the remote user to be able to access C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe remotely

Open regedit.exe on the VI, navigate to:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Terminal Server\TSAppAllowList
Navigate to fDisabledAllowList value in the right pane, set its value as "1".
Add new key under TSAppAllowList, named Applications.
Add new key under Applications, named "Calc" or whatever you want
Create two new String Values for "Calc", named "Name" and "Path".
"Name" is the human-readable name for the application, like "Calculator"
"Path" is the path to the local copy of the executable, ex C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe
Save and close

Copy the rdp file from before, and change/add the following entries:
remoteapplicationmode:i:1
remoteapplicationprogram:s:Calculator

Save the rdp file to desktop, and click it to launch the session.
It may be necessary to enter user credentials, afterward, a
seamless calc.exe window should appear

Powershell scripting:
Test-Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Terminal Server\TSAppAllowList" should be true
See reg_setup.ps1

Allowing a user to access the instance
NET LOCALGROUP "Remote Desktop Users" /ADD "<user>"
