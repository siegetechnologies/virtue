This runs any powershell scripts in the cd drive
use nssm to turn it into a service

Run the following from an admin powershell
> 'nssm install winprov'

This should bring up a GUI. Here's what you need to do
Under 'Application' tab, 'Path' should be set to the winprov.exe path
Under 'Details'->'Startup Type', choose 'Automatic (Delayed Start)'
Under 'Exit Actions'->Restart', choose 'Stop Service (oneshot mode)'
Under 'I/O', setting up a output or error log file is optional, but recommended

and set up stuff like I/O redirection, etc
