API doc for the maven_api in mod_listener
API commands are issued from the python script in userspace/maven_us.py

add_trusted_daemon <name>
	Normally, in enforcing mode, maven prevents new processes with uid 0 from starting.
	However, this prevents some necessary daemons from doing their work, as they will spawn subprocesses.
	Adding a trusted daemon allows new root-level processes to run, as long
		as they have that trusted daemon as a parent or parent of a parent.
	"add_trusted_daemon systemd" allows any process to run, since systemd is 
		an ancestor to all processes in the tree
	"add_trusted_daemon dockerd" allows new docker containers to be spawned.
	Internally, this function works by scanning the process tree for the first
		process with the given common name. It then adds that processes pid
		to a list of approved ancestors.
	This means the daemon must be started *before* this function is called.
	Once enforcing mode is turned on, no new daemons may be started, even if
		their name was added as a trusted daemon 
		(since they will have a different pid)
	Future Work:
		per-container enforcing

await_container <uuid>
	Call this before you start a docker container.
	It does some setup so other systems can retrieve a uuid from arbitrary processes
	If containers are started without this, they may be prevented from executing stuff
	The uuid must be a true uuid, verifiable with linux's uuid_is_valid function

await_virtue <uuid> <count>
	Maps the uuid to the next <count> containers
	'await_container <uuid>' is the same as 'await_virtue <uuid> 1'

set_risk <0-9>:
	Sets the global risk for the system.
	Lower risks are more permissive, and have less verbose logging
	Risk of 0 is the most permissive, allowing anything.
		This mode is intended only for testing and development.
		All user accessible systems should maintain a risk of at least 1
		NOTE: Even on risk 0, logging is still performed
	Risk of 9 is intended to be the most restrictive.
	It is not outside of scope for the risk to change without a call to this function, 
		if the system determines on its own that the risk profile has changed.
		Changing risk should never happen without a log message, however.
