Home of the linux kernel modules that make up the MAVEN microvisor
There are 4 directories here

# core/
Core functionality. Most of the logic ends up here
but should export functions which can be used by modules in impl or tests

# include/
Function prototypes for exported functions in core, provided for convenience

# tests/
Any testing code. Test modules should use the functions in linux/bug.h to generate
warning if any core functionality seems broken. They should have no side affects,
and it is perfectly acceptable for them to fail to load.
